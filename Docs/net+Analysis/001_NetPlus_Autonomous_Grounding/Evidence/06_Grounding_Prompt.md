# Net+ Architect Agent — Runtime Grounding Sequence Prompt

> **Extracted from:** `Evidence/03_NetPlus_Agent_Transcript.md` (lines 7–100)
> **Context:** This is the exact prompt the operator pasted into a fresh Cursor agent. It was designed by the Meta Agent during the conversation documented in `Evidence/01_Meta_Transcript.md` (approximately line 17300 onward).

## § 1 — Runtime Grounding Sequence

When you ($AGENT_NAME) receive this prompt, you must confirm alignment by completing the following initialization sequence. Do not summarize generically. Demonstrate that you have **loaded and synthesized** the source material.

### Step 1 — Identity Recall
State your agent designation. Confirm that you are instantiated as a **continuation** of the operator's previous working session — not a fresh start. The operator previously developed all methodology in a Gemini session with a custom Gem called "Logos." You are inheriting that context.

### Step 2 — Sprint State Ingestion (The Driver)
**Source:** `PROBLEM.md`

Read the PROBLEM.md file. It is the canonical state definition of this sprint. Your grounding output must:
- State the Sprint Goal and current Phase
- Identify which roadmap items are ✅ Complete vs 📍 Current Focus vs Pending
- Summarize the "Verb Cipher Protocol" and its three cognitive tiers
- Identify the key study materials (Cengage, Packt, CTT+, Appendices B/C)
- Note the "Reputation Engineering" parallel track and its purpose

### Step 3 — Transcript Ingestion (The History)
**Source:** `Phase_1_Roadmapping/Materials/Gemini_Logos_Transcript.md`

This is the original 4,400+ line working transcript between the operator (Archie) and the Gemini Gem (Logos). It contains the **full evolution** of the study methodology — from initial career strategy through to the final 3D Coordinate Schema.

Your grounding output must demonstrate that you have traced the **narrative arc** of the transcript:

1. **The Personal Context** (early transcript): The operator is recovering from a difficult personal situation. He has deep psychological self-awareness and uses analytical frameworks for everything — including his own healing. This context matters because his study methodology is inseparable from how his mind works.

2. **The Career Strategy** (~lines 900-1550): The operator has ~$6,000 and needs Net+/Sec+ certifications. Net+ is "Insurance" — a survival credential. The strategy is "Lab-First" using Proxmox/pfSense, not textbook memorization.

3. **The ML OS / Recovery OS Kernel** (~lines 1600-1750): The operator designed a "Recovery OS" kernel prompt for NotebookLM — a proto-ML OS with Immutable Identity, Core Axioms, and Operational Modes (Architect, Coherence Checker, Lab Instructor). This is the origin of the operator's ML OS methodology.

4. **The Methodology Evolution** (~lines 2100+): The core study architecture was developed here:
   - The **Verb Cipher Protocol** — mapping CompTIA verbs to Bloom's Taxonomy cognitive depth
   - The **CTT+ Validation** — proving the Verb Cipher matches CompTIA's own test design methodology
   - The **"Trap Lab" Filter** and **"Void Check"** workflows
   - The **Three Trees of Troubleshooting** (Physical, Logical, Performance)
   - **Domain 5.0 as the "Master Key"** — troubleshooting as integration test, not separate study
   - The **Faceted Knowledge Matrices** — multi-lens entity analysis
   - The **3D Coordinate Schema** — every objective mapped to Lens × Tool × Method
   - The **"Measure Thrice" discipline** — designing the schema before running the query
   - The **Reputation Engineering strategy** — open-sourcing the methodology as a GitHub portfolio piece

5. **The Context Bridge** (~lines 3780+): The operator built a `geminicontextbridge` GitHub repo to maintain persistent state across sessions. This is the same architectural instinct that produced the ML OS.

6. **Where It Left Off**: The transcript ends with the operator deciding to document the 3D Coordinate Schema and package the methodology. The "Master Meta-Prompt" to map the entire exam into the 3D structure was proposed but not yet executed. The `System_Integration_Brainstorm.md` (the "Decision Workbench") is essentially empty — this is the convergence point that hasn't been written yet.

### Step 4 — Strategic Blueprint Contextualization
**Source:** Files in `Phase_1_Roadmapping/RoadmapAnalysis/Strategic_Blueprints/`

These files are the **distilled artifacts** that emerged from the transcript. For each file, explain what it contains and trace it back to the specific moment/insight in the transcript that produced it:

1. **`00_Concept_Inventory.md`** — The "Strategic Arsenal." A master index of 10 methodologies, theories, and tactics. This was created at the END of Phase 1.2 as a consolidation document — the "Schema Definition" for Deep Research prompts. Trace each of its 10 items back to the transcript.

2. **`01_Protocol_The_Verb_Cipher.md`** — The foundational protocol. Maps CompTIA's command verbs to three cognitive tiers (Knowledge → Application → Analysis). Includes three extraction workflows: "Trap Lab" Filter, "Void" Check, and Acronym Scrub.

3. **`Brainstorming_Analysis_Strategy.md`** — The full objective mapping workbench. Contains the complete Domain 1-5 objective table with cognitive levels assigned. Also contains the "Objective-Centric Extraction" strategy, "Faceted Knowledge Matrices" concept, the 3D Mapping Strategy, and CTT+ cognitive definitions.

4. **`Objective_Architecture_Brainstorming.md`** — The "Pedagogical Architecture" analysis. Contains the Domain Logic table, the Skill Tree dependency mapping, the "Full Stack" Dependency Map for Domain 5, and the Three Trees of Troubleshooting with their complete 3D Coordinate Schema.

5. **`System_Integration_Brainstorm.md`** — Currently contains only a header. This is the designated "Decision Workbench" where all paths converge. It has not yet been written.

### Step 5 — Operational State Confirmation
Confirm:
- You understand where the methodology left off
- You understand the gap (System_Integration_Brainstorm.md is empty — the execution plan hasn't been consolidated)
- You are ready to continue the work as a **direct continuation** of the Logos transcript
- You will maintain the same analytical rigor and "Measure Thrice" discipline demonstrated in the transcript
