# Net+ Analysis Recap — Complete File Review

**Purpose:** Systematic walkthrough of every file in `net+Analysis/` to ensure nothing is missed before building the Sec+ equivalent.  
**Status:** In Progress — reviewing together with operator

## A. Methodology Artifacts (The "Source Code")

These are the files that define HOW the analysis works. Each one contributes a specific piece to the framework.

### A1. The Verb Cipher Protocol
> `Sprint_NetPlus/.../Strategic_Blueprints/01_Protocol_The_Verb_Cipher.md`

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **What it does** | Maps CompTIA command verbs → Bloom's Taxonomy cognitive tiers (L1 Knowledge, L2 Application, L3 Analysis) |
| **Validated by** | CTT+ Table 8-1 (CompTIA's own trainer methodology) |
| **Three extraction workflows** | (1) Trap Lab Filter — kills busy-work labs where CompTIA verb is only "Explain"; (2) Void Check — finds L3 objectives missing labs; (3) Acronym Scrub — discards terms not on official list |
| **Sec+ portability** | **Direct port.** Same CompTIA verb structure. Same Bloom's mapping. |
| **Reviewed** | ☐ |

### A2. The Three Trees of Troubleshooting
> `Sprint_NetPlus/.../Strategic_Blueprints/Objective_Architecture_Brainstorming.md`  
> `NetPlus-Cognitive-Protocol/02_The_Dependency_Map/Troubleshooting_Vectors.md`

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **What it does** | Organizes Domain 5 into three failure-mode "lenses": [PHY] Physical Reality (5.2), [LOG] Logical Reality (5.3), [PRF] Performance Reality (5.4) |
| **Key insight** | Domain 5 is the "integration test" for Domains 1-4 — if you can troubleshoot it, you already know everything else |
| **Troubleshooting_Vectors.md adds** | Specific failure modes per tree (e.g., PHY: split pair, crosstalk, PoE failure), diagnostic tools per tree, dependency prerequisites per tree, the full DAG as text art, and the "Stress-Test" study method (use D5 failures to audit D1-D4 understanding) |
| **Sec+ portability** | **Needs full rethink.** Sec+ has no single troubleshooting domain. Need equivalent structural insight. Working hypothesis: PREVENT/DETECT/RESPOND/GOVERN lenses. |
| **Reviewed** | ☐ |

### A3. The 3D Coordinate Schema
> `Sprint_NetPlus/.../Strategic_Blueprints/Brainstorming_Analysis_Strategy.md`

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **What it does** | Transforms linear exam list into a 3D database: Lens (which Tree) × Tool (which 5.5 instrument) × Method (which 5.1 lifecycle stage) |
| **Also contains** | Objective-Centric Extraction (re-assemble textbook by objective, not chapter), Faceted Knowledge Matrices (entity studied through multiple lenses), Dynamic Lens Inference (the exam question dictates which lens matters), CTT+ cognitive definitions |
| **Sec+ portability** | Schema concept ports. Axes need redefinition — Tool axis becomes distributed (4.4+4.5+4.9), Method axis could map to IR lifecycle (4.8). |
| **Reviewed** | ☐ |

### A4. The Domain Architecture / Skill Trees
> `Sprint_NetPlus/.../Strategic_Blueprints/Objective_Architecture_Brainstorming.md`

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **What it does** | Maps the "pedagogical architecture" — how domains relate as a lifecycle narrative (Dictionary → Build → Run → Protect → Fix) |
| **Dependency DAG** | Every L2 objective traces to L1 prerequisites; every L3 traces through L2 to L1. Critical path node: 1.4 (Ports/Protocols) feeds 9 downstream objectives |
| **"Full Stack" Map** | Each D5 troubleshooting objective's complete prerequisite chain traced back to D1-D4 |
| **Wrapper Layer insight** | 5.1 (Method) and 5.5 (Tools) are NOT standalone study topics — they are attributes of every other objective |
| **Sec+ portability** | DAG concept ports directly. Need to identify Sec+ critical path nodes and lifecycle narrative. |
| **Reviewed** | ☐ |

### A5. The Concept Inventory (Strategic Arsenal)
> `Sprint_NetPlus/.../Strategic_Blueprints/00_Concept_Inventory.md`

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **What it does** | Master index of 10 methodologies/theories/tactics — the "Schema Definition" for Deep Research prompts |
| **The 10 items** | (1) Verb Cipher, (2) 3D Coordinate Schema, (3) Three Trees, (4) D5 as Master Key, (5) Dynamic Lens Inference, (6) Objective-Centric Extraction, (7) Faceted Knowledge Matrices, (8) Void Check, (9) Contextualized Embeddings, (10) Appendix Integration Strategy |
| **Sec+ portability** | Items 1, 6, 7, 8 port directly. Items 2-5 need adaptation. Items 9-10 need Sec+ equivalents. |
| **Reviewed** | ☐ |

### A6. The System Integration Brainstorm (Convergence Document)
> `Sprint_NetPlus/.../Strategic_Blueprints/System_Integration_Brainstorm.md`

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **What it does** | Bridges analysis → execution. Contains: convergence map (ASCII art showing how all artifacts feed into pipeline), state of analysis table (10 validated artifacts), the gap table (what's missing), execution pipeline (4-stage: Specification → Meta-Prompt → Mapping Run → Schedule), decision matrix for edge cases, reputation engineering integration with sanitization rules, and success criteria |
| **Key content I hadn't captured before** | The execution pipeline stages (Stage 0-4), the sanitization protocol (public vs. proprietary sources), the decision matrix for multi-lens objectives and wrapper layer application, bi-directional dependency requirement |
| **Sec+ portability** | Structure ports directly as a template. Content needs complete rewrite for Sec+ context. |
| **Reviewed** | ☐ |

## B. Execution Artifacts (What the Methodology Produced)

### B1. The MetaPrompt (Adversarial Roundtable)
> `Sprint_NetPlus/.../RoadmapAnalysis/MetaPrompt_3D_Mapping.md`

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **What it does** | Simulates 5 adversarial expert personas who challenge each other before synthesizing the 3D Mapping Table |
| **The 5 experts** | (1) Bloom's Taxonomy Enforcer, (2) Network Failure Mode Analyst, (3) Toolchain Mapper, (4) Dependency Graph Architect, (5) Meta-Prompt Engineer |
| **Structure** | Persona definitions → Context (the 3D problem + Verb Cipher + Three Trees + full objective list) → Phase 1: Adversarial Debate (specific challenges per expert) → Phase 2: Synthesis (notation + table + DAG + audit + gap report + study sequence) → Output Schema |
| **Sec+ portability** | Structure ports. Personas need replacement (e.g., Threat Modeler, SOC Analyst, GRC Analyst, Pen Tester, Exam Architect). |
| **Reviewed** | ☐ |

### B2. The 3D Mapping Table
> `Sprint_NetPlus/.../RoadmapAnalysis/3D_Mapping_Table.md`

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **What it does** | Complete mapping of all 25 N10-009 objectives across 11 columns: Obj ID, Title, Verb, Level, Primary Lens, Secondary Lens(es), Primary Tool (5.5), Verification Tool, Method Stage (5.1), Dependencies, Void Flag |
| **Key outputs** | Dependency DAG (text art), Multi-Lens Audit (7 multi-lens, 2 triple-lens objectives), Gap Report (1 confirmed gap at 5.2, 9 pending verification), Study Sequence (4 phases: Foundation Lock → Skill Unlock → Mastery Gate → Validation), Statistics Summary |
| **Tool mapping detail** | Every objective has specific tool bindings — not "Wireshark" but "Wireshark (`bootp` filter)" — and L2 objectives have separate config tool vs. verification tool |
| **Sec+ portability** | This is the main deliverable to reproduce. Same table structure, Sec+ content. |
| **Reviewed** | ☐ |

### B3. Deep Research Prompts (Public Version)
> `NetPlus-Cognitive-Protocol/04_Tools_and_Scripts/Deep_Research_Prompts.md`

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **What it does** | Public-facing version of the Roundtable methodology + **TWO prompts** (not just one) |
| **Prompt 1** | 3D Objective Mapping (the main one — maps objectives to Lens/Tool/Method) |
| **Prompt 2 — MISSED EARLIER** | **Difficulty Calibration** — separate 5-expert Roundtable: Psychometrician, Content Domain Architect, Cognitive Efficiency Strategist, PBQ Game Theorist, Meta-Prompt Engineer. 5 research passes: Syllabus Topography → Item Design Analysis → Simulation Mechanics → Efficiency Audit → Final Calibration. Outputs: Depth-O-Meters, Trap Identification, Stop-Studying Criteria |
| **"Adapting for Other Certifications" section** | Explicitly says: (1) replace objective list, (2) adjust Verb Cipher if needed, (3) modify Three Trees for target exam's taxonomy, (4) keep adversarial panel structure |
| **Sec+ portability** | Both prompts need Sec+ versions. Prompt 2 is especially valuable — calibrating "when to stop studying" per domain. |
| **Reviewed** | ☐ |

## C. Scaffold / State Tracking

### C1. PROBLEM.md (Sprint State Tracker)
> `Sprint_NetPlus/PROBLEM.md`

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **What it does** | Canonical project state: Goal, Roadmap phases with checkboxes (1.1–1.5), Strategy Note, Verb Cipher summary table, Advanced Tactics, Appendix Strategy, complete Asset Inventory with file paths |
| **Sec+ portability** | Direct template. Replace Net+ content with Sec+ phases and materials. |
| **Reviewed** | ☐ |

### C2. The Grounding Prompt (Agent Boot Sequence)
> `001_.../Evidence/06_Grounding_Prompt.md`

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **What it does** | 100-line prompt with 5-step Runtime Grounding Sequence: (1) Identity Recall, (2) Sprint State Ingestion, (3) Transcript Ingestion with narrative arc map, (4) Strategic Blueprint Contextualization, (5) Operational State Confirmation |
| **Key design principle** | Asks agent to TRACE the evolution, not summarize — forces deep extraction over shallow comprehension |
| **Sec+ portability** | Template for Sec+ grounding prompt once our analysis produces the equivalent artifacts. |
| **Reviewed** | ☐ |

### C3. The Agent Plan
> `001_.../Evidence/05_Agent_Plan.md`

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **What it does** | Full grounding output of the Net+ agent — 5 steps executed, all 10 Concept Inventory items traced to specific transcript line numbers, complete blueprint contextualization |
| **Notable** | Contains the most detailed provenance table (each of the 10 strategic arsenal items mapped to exact transcript line ranges) |
| **Sec+ portability** | Reference for expected agent output quality. |
| **Reviewed** | ☐ |

## F. Things I Initially Missed (Caught During Review)

| Item | Where Found | Why It Matters |
|------|------------|----------------|
| **Prompt 2: Difficulty Calibration** | `Deep_Research_Prompts.md` | Separate 5-expert Roundtable for calibrating exam difficulty, stop-studying criteria, PBQ analysis. Needs Sec+ equivalent. |
| **Troubleshooting_Vectors.md detail** | `02_The_Dependency_Map/` | Not just the Three Trees names — contains specific failure modes, diagnostic tools per tree, dependency tables, full text DAG, wrapper layer definitions, and the "Stress-Test" study method |
| **System_Integration_Brainstorm.md detail** | Strategic_Blueprints/ | Contains the execution pipeline stages, sanitization protocol, multi-lens decision matrix, bi-directional dependency requirement, success criteria. Much more than "a convergence doc." |
| **Distributed Tool Layer problem** | SY0-701 structure | Net+ had 5.5 as single tool wrapper. Sec+ distributes tools across 4.4 + 4.5 + 4.9 + 2.5 + Page 21 hardware list. Fundamental structural difference for the coordinate system. |
| **Three wrapper layers hypothesis** | Sec+ adaptation | 4.8 (IR Process) = Method wrapper; 4.4+4.5+4.9 = Tool wrapper; 2.5 = Controls wrapper. Net+ only had two wrappers. |
| **"Adapting for Other Certifications"** | `Deep_Research_Prompts.md` | Explicit 4-step adaptation guide already written for this exact purpose |
| **Skill_Trees.md Mermaid diagrams** | `02_The_Dependency_Map/` | 4 Mermaid.js diagrams: Switching Skill Tree, Complete DAG, Three Trees Convergence View, Study Order Priority. Sec+ needs equivalent visualizations. |
| **Faceted Matrix methodology** | `Brainstorming_Analysis_Strategy.md` | Not just "compare entities" — includes Dynamic Lens Inference (the exam question dictates which lens). Need to identify Sec+ entities for matrix treatment. |
| **Python tooling** | `Tools/` and `Cengage_Materials/Tools/` | 6 Python scripts for PDF extraction, objective parsing, transcript handling. May need Sec+ equivalents. |
