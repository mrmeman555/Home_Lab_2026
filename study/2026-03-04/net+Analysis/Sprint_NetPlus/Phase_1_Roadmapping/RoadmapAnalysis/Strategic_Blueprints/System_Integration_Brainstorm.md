## 2. State of the Analysis (What We Have)

### 2.1 Validated Artifacts

| # | Artifact | Status | Validation |
|---|----------|--------|------------|
| 1 | **Verb Cipher Protocol** (3 tiers) | Locked | CTT+ Table 8-1 confirms Bloom's mapping. Bug patched (Troubleshoot = Level 3, not 2). |
| 2 | **Objective Mapping Table** (25 objectives) | Complete | All D1-D5 objectives classified to cognitive level. |
| 3 | **Three Trees** (PHY/LOG/PRF) | Designed | 5.2 = Physical, 5.3 = Logical, 5.4 = Performance. Dependencies traced. |
| 4 | **3D Coordinate Schema** | Designed | Lens (Tree) x Tool (5.5) x Method (5.1). VLAN example validated. |
| 5 | **Dependency Maps** | Drafted | Full Stack map for 5.2/5.3/5.4 prerequisites. |
| 6 | **Wrapper Layer Insight** | Confirmed | 5.1 and 5.5 are attributes of every topic, not standalone study items. |
| 7 | **Trap Lab Filter** | Designed | Workflow A from Verb Cipher. Not yet executed across all chapters. |

| 9 | **Acronym Scrub** | Designed | Workflow C from Verb Cipher. Not yet executed. |
| 10 | **Appendix Integration** | Defined | B = Calculation Protocol (LOG tree), C = Validation Instrument. |

### 2.2 The Gap (What We Do Not Have)

| # | Missing Artifact | Required For | Blocking? |
|---|-----------------|--------------|-----------|
| 1 | **3D Mapping Table** — Every D1-D4 objective mapped to Lens/Tool/Method | Study schedule, lab prioritization, the entire execution phase | **YES** |
| 2 | **Master Meta-Prompt** — The Deep Research Factory prompt to generate the mapping | Producing artifact #1 at scale | **YES** |
| 3 | **Trap Lab / Void Check Execution** — Running the Verb Cipher across all 12 Cengage chapters | Filtering busy-work, identifying gaps | No (can run in parallel) |
| 4 | **GitHub Repo Structure** — Sanitized, public-facing packaging | Reputation Engineering track | No (parallel) |

---

## 3. The Execution Pipeline

### 3.1 Pipeline Architecture

The execution phase follows the Deep Research Factory's pipeline pattern — each stage's output becomes the next stage's input.

```
Stage 0: SPECIFICATION (This File)
         │
         ▼
Stage 1: MASTER META-PROMPT
         File: MetaPrompt_3D_Mapping.md
         Tool: Deep Research Factory (Roundtable Methodology)
         Input: Concept Inventory + Verb Cipher + Three Trees + Appendix A objectives
         Output: The prompt that drives Stage 2
         │
         ▼
Stage 2: 3D MAPPING RUN
         File: 3D_Mapping_Table.md
         Tool: Deep Research (Gemini/Perplexity) OR Cursor Agent
         Input: Master Meta-Prompt + Appendix A PDF + Verb Cipher Protocol
         Output: Master table mapping all D1-D4 objectives to Lens/Tool/Method
         │
         ▼
Stage 3: STUDY SCHEDULE GENERATION
         File: Study_Schedule.md (Phase 1.5)
         Input: 3D Mapping Table + Dependency Maps
         Output: Calendar weighted by cognitive depth (L3 > L2 > L1)
         │
         ▼
Stage 4: LAB GENERATION
         Input: 3D Mapping Table (filtered: L2 + L3 only) + Void Check results
         Output: Proxmox/pfSense lab specifications for every L2/L3 objective
```

### 3.2 Stage 1 Specification: The Master Meta-Prompt

**What it must do:**
1. Accept the N10-009 Appendix A objectives as input
2. For each objective in Domains 1-4, assign three coordinates:
   - **Lens** (Vertical): Which Tree does it feed? `[PHY]`, `[LOG]`, or `[PRF]`
   - **Tool** (Horizontal): Which 5.5 instrument inspects it?
   - **Method** (Depth): Which 5.1 lifecycle stage applies?
3. Flag objectives that map to **multiple** lenses (e.g., "Wireless" is both `[PHY]` for RF interference and `[LOG]` for authentication protocols)
4. Apply the Verb Cipher to confirm cognitive level for each objective
5. Run the Void Check — flag any Level 3 objective where no corresponding lab exists in Cengage

**What it must NOT do:**
- Generate study content (that is Phase 2)
- Produce flashcards or lab instructions (premature)
- Summarize the textbook (we already have Chapter Reviews)

**Prompt Architecture (following Deep Research Factory standard):**
- **Persona:** 5 adversarial expert specialists (see Meta-Prompt file for full spec)
- **Context:** The Verb Cipher Protocol + Three Trees + 3D Coordinate Schema + full objective list
- **Phase 1:** Adversarial debate on edge-case classifications (multi-lens objectives, wrapper layers)
- **Phase 2:** Synthesis into the master 3D Mapping Table
- **Output Schema:** See Section 4 below

### 3.3 Stage 2 Specification: The 3D Mapping Run

**Input Requirements:**
1. The Master Meta-Prompt (Stage 1 output)
2. CompTIA N10-009 Official Exam Objectives (Appendix A PDF)
3. The Verb Cipher Protocol document
4. The Three Trees dependency map

**Output Schema:**

| Obj ID | Objective Title | Verb | Level | Lens(es) | Primary Tool (5.5) | Method Stage (5.1) | Dependencies | Void? |
|--------|----------------|------|-------|----------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|-------|
| 1.1 | OSI Model | Explain | L1 | [LOG] | Wireshark (layer analysis) | Identify the Problem | — | N/A (L1) |
| 1.5 | Transmission Media | Compare | L1 | [PHY] | Cable Tester / OTDR | Verify Physical | — | N/A (L1) |
| 2.2 | Switching Config | Configure | L2 | [LOG],[PHY] | `show mac address-table` | Test the Theory | 1.2, 1.4, 1.6 | Check |
| 5.3 | Network Services TS | Troubleshoot | L3 | [LOG] | Wireshark / `nslookup` | Full Lifecycle | 1.4, 2.2, 3.4 | Check |

*(Above are examples. Full table covers all 25 objectives.)*

**Lens Assignment Rules:**
- `[PHY]` = The objective's failure mode is physical (hardware, cabling, power, RF interference, environmental)
- `[LOG]` = The objective's failure mode is logical (wrong address, wrong protocol, wrong config, authentication failure)
- `[PRF]` = The objective's failure mode is performance (slow, congested, jittery, high latency)
- Multi-lens tagging allowed when an objective spans failure modes (e.g., Wireless: `[PHY]` for signal + `[LOG]` for auth + `[PRF]` for throughput)

**Method Stage Definitions (from 5.1 Troubleshooting Methodology):**
1. Identify the Problem
2. Establish a Theory of Probable Cause
3. Test the Theory
4. Establish a Plan of Action
5. Implement / Verify
6. Document Findings

**Tool Categories (from 5.5):**
- **Physical:** Cable Tester, OTDR, Multimeter, Toner Probe, Light Meter, Punchdown Tool
- **Logical/Software:** Wireshark, `ping`, `traceroute`, `nslookup`, `dig`, `ipconfig`/`ifconfig`, `netstat`, `arp`, `show` commands (CLI)
- **Performance:** SNMP, NetFlow, Bandwidth Speed Tester, `iperf`, Protocol Analyzer
- **Documentation:** Network Diagrams, Baseline Documentation, Change Management Logs

## 4. The Decision Matrix (Open Questions)

These are the analytical edge cases that the Master Meta-Prompt must resolve through its adversarial debate phase.

### 4.1 Multi-Lens Objectives

| Objective | Candidate Lenses | Resolution Required |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 1.5 (Transmission Media) | `[PHY]` obviously, but cable *specifications* (Category ratings, fiber modes) also feed `[PRF]` | Primary: PHY. Secondary: PRF. |
| 2.3 (Wireless Config) | `[PHY]` (antennas, channels, interference), `[LOG]` (SSID, auth, encryption), `[PRF]` (throughput, standards) | **Triple-lens.** Must be studied through all three trees. |
| 3.2 (Monitoring) | `[PRF]` obviously, but monitoring *tools* are also used for `[LOG]` troubleshooting | Primary: PRF. Tool-layer overlap with LOG. |
| 4.3 (Security Solutions) | `[LOG]` (ACLs, firewall rules), but physical security is also in scope | Primary: LOG. Flag PHY sub-items. |

### 4.2 Wrapper Layer Application

5.1 (Methodology) and 5.5 (Tools) are attributes, not standalone topics. The Meta-Prompt must enforce:
- **Every** mapped objective gets a Tool assignment (which 5.5 instrument?)
- **Every** L2/L3 objective gets a Method assignment (which 5.1 stage is the "test point"?)
- L1 objectives get "Identify the Problem" as default Method (they support the first step of troubleshooting)

### 4.3 Dependency Chain Validation

The existing dependency maps in `Objective_Architecture_Brainstorming.md` cover the "Full Stack" for 5.2/5.3/5.4. But the 3D Mapping run must also produce **forward dependencies** for D1-D4 objectives:
- Each D1 objective should list which D2/D3/D5 objectives it feeds
- Each D2 objective should list which D5 objective it unlocks
- This creates a bi-directional graph, not just a top-down tree

---

## 5. Reputation Engineering Integration

### 5.1 Public-Facing Artifact Map

Every artifact produced in the execution pipeline has a public-facing version for the `NetPlus-Cognitive-Protocol` GitHub repo.

| Internal Artifact | Public Version | Sanitization Rule |
|------------------|---------------|------------------|
| Verb Cipher Protocol | `01_The_Verb_Cipher/Protocol.md` | Already clean. Uses only CompTIA objectives PDF (public). |
| 3D Mapping Table | `03_The_Matrices/3D_Mapping_Table.md` | Remove Cengage chapter references. Reference only Appendix A objective IDs. |
| Three Trees + Dependencies | `02_The_Dependency_Map/Troubleshooting_Vectors.md` | Already clean. Derived from objective structure. |
| Skill Tree Diagrams | `02_The_Dependency_Map/Switching_Skill_Tree.mermaid` | Generate Mermaid.js diagrams. No proprietary content. |
| Deep Research Prompts | `04_Tools_and_Scripts/Deep_Research_Prompts.md` | The actual prompts are "the code." Fully publishable. |
| Concept Inventory | `README.md` (condensed) | Rewrite as public-facing methodology overview. |

### 5.2 Source Data Hygiene Rules

**Allowed Sources (Public):**
- CompTIA N10-009 Official Exam Objectives PDF (freely available on comptia.org)
- Packt Publishing GitHub repos (MIT/public license)
- CompTIA CTT+ Bloom's Taxonomy framework (general pedagogical knowledge)

**Prohibited Sources (Proprietary):**
- Cengage textbook content (page numbers, direct quotes, chapter text)
- Cengage Hands-On Project instructions
- Practice exam questions (Appendix C content)

**Sanitization Protocol:**
1. Reference objectives by ID only (e.g., "Objective 2.2" not "Chapter 7, Section 2")
2. Describe concepts in your own words, never quote the textbook
3. Lab instructions must be original (Proxmox/pfSense-based, not Cengage reproductions)

---

## 6. Execution Sequence (The Immediate Next Actions)

| Step | Action | Output File | Depends On |
|------|--------|------------|-----------|
| **1** | Build the Master Meta-Prompt using Deep Research Factory Roundtable format | `MetaPrompt_3D_Mapping.md` | This file (complete) |
| **2** | Execute the 3D Mapping Run (feed Meta-Prompt to DR engine or execute locally) | `3D_Mapping_Table.md` | Step 1 |
| **3** | Initialize `NetPlus-Cognitive-Protocol/` repo structure with sanitized artifacts | Repo folder structure | Steps 1-2 + existing blueprints |
| **4** | Run Trap Lab Filter across all 12 Cengage chapters | `Trap_Lab_Audit.md` | Verb Cipher (done) |
| **5** | Run Void Check across L3 objectives | `Void_Check_Audit.md` | Step 2 (needs mapping) |
| **6** | Generate Study Schedule weighted by cognitive depth | `Study_Schedule.md` | Steps 2 + 5 |

Steps 1-3 are the **critical path**. Steps 4-6 can begin once Step 2 completes.

---

## 7. Success Criteria

The Phase 1.2 → 1.3 transition is complete when:

- [ ] The Master Meta-Prompt is built and follows Deep Research Factory standards
- [ ] The 3D Mapping Table covers all 25 N10-009 objectives with Lens/Tool/Method coordinates
- [ ] Every Level 2 and Level 3 objective has explicit dependencies traced to prerequisite Level 1 objectives
- [ ] The Void Check has identified every Level 3 gap (CompTIA says "Troubleshoot" but no Cengage lab exists)
- [ ] The GitHub repo structure is initialized with sanitized versions of all methodology artifacts
- [ ] The operator (Archie) has reviewed and confirmed the mapping before any study schedule is generated

**The "Measure Thrice" Discipline applies:** No study execution begins until the operator is confident in this foundation.
